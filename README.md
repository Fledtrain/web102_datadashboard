# Web Development Project 5 - WeatherReporter App

Submitted by: Joey Whitehead

This web app: WeatherReporter App utilizes the https://www.weatherbit.io/ API to fetch weather reports throughout the global and display them in a beautiful table. Just enter the city you want and the app will fetch the weather report for you. You can filter the data by city, unit temperature!

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The list displays a list of data fetched using an API call**
- [x] **Data uses the useEffect React hook and async/await syntax**
- [x] **The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data such as**
- [x] _City, Country, Sunset Time, Station, Temperature, Elevation Angle and Weather_
- [x] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
- [x] **Multiple different filters (2+) allow the user to filter items in the database by specified categories**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

I had trouble with the API call and getting the data to display in the table but I figured out how to do it, by saving it in state.
